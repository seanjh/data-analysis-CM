    "# An Analysis Site Design's Impact on RateBeer.com Review Contributions\n",
    "#### jhh283, sjh293\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Preece and Schneiderman's Reader-to-Leader Framework (RTLF) [1] details a number of usability and sociability factors that sites can deploy to help promote contributions of user generated content (UGC). In particular, the paper describes \"visibility for...contributions\" as a motivating factor for ongoing contributions of UGC, along with a \"recognition of quality and quantity of contributions.\" Beenen et al. (2004) [2], building on Karau and William's Collective Effort Model [3], also demonstrated that highlighting the \"uniqueness\" of contributions on the MovieLens review site was correleated with an increase in UGC on the site. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's analysis focuses on RateBeer.com, one of the leading beer review websites, and in particular on a major overhaul of the site's user profile pages in May 2009. RateBeer's 2009 profile page redesign made numerous substantial improvements in line with recommendations offered in the RTLF paper. While the total number of reviews contributed by a user were long included on review pages, in forums posts, and on profile pages, the redesign went to great lengths to expose additional layers of detail about each user's contributions, better highlighting the uniqueness, completeness, and quality of each user's corpus of beer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the findings in the Preece and Schneiderman's RTLF, we hypothesized that a substantial site redesign which incorporated Preece and Schneiderman's recommendations would result in a measureable increase in the quantity and diversity of UGC. More specifically, the increased visibility on profile pages after May 2009 of a user's beer review variants, the introduction of an activity stream, and clearer presentation of a user's contributions, all in line with RTLF recommendations, would result in a corresponding increase in contributions within at most a year after the launch date."

    "In an effort to confirm our hypothesis, we identified RateBeer redesigns that adhered to the RTLF principles. To pinpoint these redesigns, and to allow for a comparison of the site before and after the redesign, we scanned page archives captured by the Way Back Machine service (archive.org). We quickly realized that many site redesigns were incremental, and that large, site wide redesigns were comparatively rare occerence. One particular redesign did stick out, however, and that was the update to user profile pages launched by RateBeer administrators beginning on May 3, 2009 (forum posts from that time suggest the feature was rolled out of a period of a few weeks)[4]."

    "### Activity Stream and Top Styles\n",
    "These two screen captures above show a heavy user's profile as it appeared on April (figure 1, above) and August of 2009 (figure 2, above). Aside from the aesthetic changes, several key changes stand out. Most notable is the introduction of a new \"activity\" stream (figure 3, below). This feature is a sort of automated social awareness stream of an individual's UGC across the site, likely inspired by the success of Facebook around this time. Furthermore, while statistics were previously available behind the \"Statistics\" tab on the old site, RateBeer replaced the simple reverse chronological listing of reviews with an interesting summary of the user's  contributions by beer style. This beer style chart, standing clearly out on its white background, also draws attention to a more prominent link to the full page of statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their MovieLens study, Breece et al. explain that \"the collective effort model posits that people will socially loaf less when they perceive that their contribution is important to the group...if they think they are unique, they should be more motivated to contribute.\" [3] The top styles chart in particular, and the increased emphasis on each user's contribution characteristics over the plain listing of reviews more generally, appears to be designed to better represent the uniqueness of each contributor. These features allow \"contributors to stand out,\" as Preece and Schneiderman put it."

The moving average (red trend line) provides a cleaner depiction of the fluctuations in contribution of new reviews over time. The overall trend over the full time period is best represented by the linear model we fit to the full dataset (blue trendline).\n",

Given that the user profile page displayed a chart of the user's reviews by style, we expected to see the rate of reviews of \"other\" style to increase following the redesign.

    "###High-level Feature Trends\n",
    "As we brainstormed features which may reflect a user's engagement level, we eventually settled on the following variables: number of reviews contributed, review diversity (types of beers being reviewed), average review rating (score), and average review length (word count). \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we were interested in seeing how each of these variables changed \"pre-split\" to \"post-split\" based on the user's relative amount of reviews contributed \"pre-split\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to look at these features, we sorted the user dataset based on the number of reviews each user contributed \"pre-split\" and calculated a plus-minus value for each of the variables we looked at (plus-minus calculated as value_post_split - value_pre_split). We then plotted these values for the entire population and calculated mean, median, and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of our analysis, we noticed that high-usage users typically exhibited more extreme changes in plus-minus. For this reason, we also performed the mean/median/stdev analysis for the top 5% of users. In order to provide a control for these high-usage users, we paired the high-usage statistics with the numbers for a ramdomly sampled group of the same size from the entire dataset as well as the \"long tail\" of 95% other users."

    "Even though no clear linear correlation is apparent to us based on our analysis so far of the select features, we thought it'd be worthwhile to test different linear classification methods with our selected feature (especially considering the potential non-linear correlation we've noticed). By doing so, we would be able to evaluate how predictive our set of features really is (based on an actual model evaluation accuracy score). \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we were interested in whether our identified list of features could be used to predict whether a user's review contribution would increase or decrease followiing the change in the website. As we were attempting to create a positive/negative classifier, we first created a balanced pool of data to work from -- where there were an equal number of positive and negative samples (where positive/negative is determined by the user's review count plus-minus).  Following this, we split the data pool 80/20 into a training and test set. We chose to perform cross_validation (n=4) to evaluate different models and used a standard mean/standard deviation scaling to normalize our feature values. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this assignment, we looked at 4 different sklearn classifiers: rbf SVM, linear SVM, dual-l2 logistic regression, non-dual-l2 logistic regression. From a cross-validation score, the model which performed best was the rbf SVM algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this resulted in a 62% accuracy (consistent with the output from the other classifiers) -- a score that is not very good and not that much better than random. This leads us to believe that the features we selected are not strongly predictive of future review contributions to the RateBeer website. "

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Both the analysis we’ve performed site-wide and at a user level provide entirely inconclusive results for our hypothesis. Although we did identify some interesting correlation for the user-level features we looked at and were able to identify other interesting site-level occurrences (namely the 2008 hacking), we were unable to identify any significant changes in user engagement and Ratebeer.com site usage when comparing before and after the profile page redesign. Although the connective media theory we selected (reader-to-leader framework) seems reasonable to both of us and, if true, would dictate that user engagement should have increased due to the design changes, we were unable to identify any increase (or even significant change) in site and user usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our analysis, we have two major theories as to why this is the case:\n",
    "* Because of the drop in site availability associated with the 11/2008 - 12/2008 site-wide hacking, site usage (namely the growth and contribution of reviews) was skewed. As we saw in the data, we noticed a general negative trend in usage over the period of time where this profile change was introduced. It’s highly likely that the psychological impact of not having the website available created a negative connotation with RateBeer.com which stifled growth and outweighed any benefits that the profile page changes may have brought. In some ways, it’s equivalent to an anti-critical-mass — where no users are using the page (due to the lack of availability) and therefore users are less likely to use the page overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Profile page redesign, although significant, isn’t something that most users to the website will notice on a day-to-day basis (when browsing reviews and forums). Even though this specific page was completely redesigned with strong social-psychological signals suggesting that usage should increase, the overall design of Ratebeer.com didn’t change. Without some cue to visit this page in the normal user-flow, it’s unlikely for users to be motivated to change their behavior and contribution patterns."
