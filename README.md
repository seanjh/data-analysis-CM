### Installation Directions
This assignment is primarily contained within BeerDataAnalysis.ipynb. All of the write up and code associated with this assignment can be found in this iPython notebook.

In order for this notebook to run through completion, there are the following requirements:
* a data/ directory should be found in the root - should contain Ratebeer.txt.gz downloaded from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/cse255/data/beer/Ratebeer.txt.gz
* run the code found in ParseBeerData.ipynb - this should create a file called data/reduced_data.txt which is used by the BeerDataAnalysis notebook
* an images/ directory should exist as preconfigured in this repo/directory
